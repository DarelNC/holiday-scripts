# holiday-scripts
A holiday version of those popular ascii-scripts. 
Note: I don't know who the orginal creator of those scripts is, I just created new versions.
If you do, please let me know so that I can give proper credit.

## General info
The bash-scripts display a color scheme in your terminal: one with christmas trees, one with snowflakes, one with Santa a reindeers, one with Easter bunnies and one with pumpkins.
